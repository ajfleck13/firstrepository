    <h1>Anthony (AJ) Fleck's Personal Page</h1>

    <p>
        I'm a hobbyist coder with a degree in physics. I got into coding after playing an open source game with a small community,
        after dealing with bugs in the game for too long I decided to fix them myself. This lead me to learning much about object
        oriented programming. In my spare time I enjoy playing games, practicing cooking, and walking my dog.
